****ABOUT****

To predict the Type of star based on data such as Temperature of surface, luminosity of star, color and other physical attributes.

****Purpose:****


In astronomy the early classification, distribution, and cataloging of stars have helped us understand how they make up our galaxy. This classification scheme has accelerated discoveries in astronomy and astrophysics through the support of an all-sky spectroscopic observation program that uses telescopes in both hemispheres to comprehensively map the night sky, examine the history and structure of the universe, and probe the physics of black holes.

These next-generation telescopes are predicted to significantly increase the size of source catalogs and data and it will become unfeasible for astronomers to manually verify and label individual sources.

****TARGET  VARIABLE****


Type : Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , Super Giants, Hyper Giants

One hot encoded from categorical to numeric (0 to 5) as follows :

Red Dwarf - 0
Brown Dwarf - 1
White Dwarf - 2
Main Sequence - 3
Super Giants - 4
Hyper Giants - 5

****MATH  AND FORMULEA****
Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)

Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
